### Installing Dependencies

The application relies upon various JS libraries, such as AngularJS and jQuery, and Node.js tools,
such as [Karma][karma] and [Protractor][protractor]. You can install these by running:

```
npm install
```

This will also download the AngularJS files needed for the current step of the tutorial and copy
them to `app/lib`.

Most of the scripts described below will run this automatically but it doesn't do any harm to run
it whenever you like.

*Note copying the AngularJS files from `node_modules` to `app/lib` makes it easier to serve the
files by a web server.*

### Running the Application during Development

- Run `npm start`.
- Navigate your browser to [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to see the application
  running.

### Unit Testing

We recommend using [Jasmine][jasmine] and [Karma][karma] for your unit tests/specs, but you are free
to use whatever works for you.

- Start Karma with `npm test`.
- A browser will start and connect to the Karma server. Chrome and Firefox are the default browsers,
  others can be captured by loading the same URL or by changing the `karma.conf.js` file.
- Karma will sit and watch your application and test JavaScript files. To run or re-run tests just
  change any of your these files.
